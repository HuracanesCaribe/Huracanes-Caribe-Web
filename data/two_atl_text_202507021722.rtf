For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of America:

1. Near the Southeastern U.S.:
An area of low pressure could develop near the southeast U.S. 
Atlantic or Gulf coasts by this weekend along a weakening frontal 
boundary. Environmental conditions appear only marginally conducive 
for some slow development, but a tropical or subtropical depression 
could form in this region over the weekend or early next week while 
the system drifts northward or northeastward. Regardless of 
development, heavy rainfall is possible across portions of the 
southeast U.S., particularly across the west-central Florida coast. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. 
* Formation chance through 7 days...medium...40 percent.
